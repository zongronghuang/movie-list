# Movie List
***

### About

This movie list is a personal project for Alpha Camp's Semester 2. 

The movie list connects to a specialized movie database API^[first] provided by Alpha Camp. It sorts fetched data by movie genre. Under each movie, you also find tags that specify genres that it belongs to.
 
[^first]: The movie database API is only for educational purpose, with no intention of copyright infringement.
